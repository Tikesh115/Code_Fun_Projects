  <h1>The Story In The Book</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i> New Scientist</i>, 
     and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's 
	 favourite book since college, and the longer she spent with this four walls the she felt she needed to be free.</p>
  <p>She had spent the last four years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar wilde qoute proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of 
     people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of llama 
	 <abbr title="Dioxyribonuclic acid">DNA</abbr>, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something to do better.</p>
